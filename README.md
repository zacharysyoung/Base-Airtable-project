# Base Airtable Project

All the configs to be able to:

- develop with ESLint linting/formatting in JavaScript (EMS)
- use VSCode's type checking
- test w/Jest
- Rollup the modules into a single (MJS) file to drop into Airtable

Where I learned to do any of this:

- **airtable-globals.d.ts**: Getting JS globals recognized by the TS type checker (in VS Code), [Working with JavaScript # Global variables and type checking](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/working-with-javascript#_global-variables-and-type-checking).
